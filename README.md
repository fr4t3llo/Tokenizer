## Token Project: Fr42t3llo (FTR)

### ⚙️ Platform Choice:
I chose **Remix IDE** for deployment because it is a simple, beginner-friendly, web-based environment that allows fast testing and deployment of smart contracts directly to the Ethereum network or testnets.

The code was written using **OpenZeppelin**, a widely-trusted library for secure and standardized smart contracts, particularly for creating ERC-20 tokens. It saves time and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.

### 💻 Language Used:
- **Solidity** (version ^0.8.22) – the standard language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### 📦 Project Description:
This repository contains a simple ERC-20 token named **Fr42t3llo (FTR)**.
The token mints **1000 FTR tokens** to the address specified during deployment.

The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation to ensure standard compatibility and security best practices.
